      <h3>Travelly and elina Joy</h3>
      <p>Travelly and elina Joy are two projects that i created as part of a course called HTML and CSS by DevEd. The website pictures and the ideas were given to me as course material.
       I have used html, css, animation, sass, css grid, flexbox and some other css features while developing these two websites.
      </p>
      <h3>The movie website</h3>
      <p>
        The movie website is a multipage website developed by me, which uses html,css and <span style="color : #5ED3F3">react</span> .
        this website is my bachelor's degree final project which i got 20 out of 20 for it. i spent almost 3 weeks creating and styling it. 
        My purpose was to create a movie website that shows the lates and toprate dmovies and series like IMDB. 
        I'v used styled components, global style, bootstrap framework and material ui and animations are powered by framer motion.
        This website also benefits from redux as state manager. The data that is shown in the movie website is pulled from <a style="color: rgb(108, 108, 108);" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">tmdb</a>  api (you need to have vpn so pictures can load from tmdb).
